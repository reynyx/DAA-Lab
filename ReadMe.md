# Design and Analysis of Algorithms Lab

This repository contains lab experiments and assignments for the **Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA)** course. It covers key algorithmic techniques, problem-solving strategies, and performance analysis.

## Topics Covered

- **Sorting Algorithms**: Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort, etc.
- **Graph Algorithms**: BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's Algorithm, etc.
- **Divide and Conquer**: Strassen's Matrix Multiplication, Binary Search.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Knapsack Problem, Longest Common Subsequence.
- **Greedy Algorithms**: Huffman Coding, Minimum Spanning Tree.


## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd DAA Lab
    ```

3. Run the experiments:
    - Each lab experiment is stored in a separate folder with code and documentation.
